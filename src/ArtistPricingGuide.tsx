                    Pricing your artwork is both an art and a science. The right price
                    not only covers your costs — it reflects your skill, career stage,
                    and the unique value of your work. Here’s a step-by-step strategy
                    you can use for fair and consistent pricing.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">1. Factor in Materials</h2>
                <p className="text-2xl mb-4">
                    Begin with your direct costs: paints, canvas, brushes, framing,
                    printing, or any other materials. This is your base cost, and
                    you’ll build on it from here.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">2. Value Your Time</h2>
                <p className="text-2xl mb-4">
                    Set an hourly rate that reflects your skill level, experience, and
                    local market. Multiply this by the hours spent on the piece. Even
                    if you love the work, your time has value.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">3. Consider Your Career Stage</h2>
                <p className="text-2xl mb-4">
                    Established artists can often command higher prices due to demand
                    and recognition. Early-career artists may start lower to grow
                    their collector base, then raise prices over time.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">4. Factor in Overhead</h2>
                <p className="text-2xl mb-4">
                    Studio rent, utilities, tools, and marketing are part of doing
                    business. Build these into your pricing so you’re not working at a
                    loss.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">5. Adjust for Sales Channels</h2>
                <p className="text-2xl mb-4">
                    Galleries often take 30–50% commission. Online marketplaces may
                    charge listing or transaction fees. Factor these in to maintain
                    your profit margin.
                </p>

                <p className="font-thin text-2xl mt-8">
