          <p className="font-thin text-2xl mb-6">
            ArtWorth was created by an artist who knows first-hand the challenge of turning creative passion into a sustainable career. 
            After years of facing uncertainty about how to price my own work — from small commissions to large-scale installations — 
            I realized that artists everywhere were asking the same questions: <em>“How do I value my art?”</em> and 
            <em>“How do I make a living doing what I love?”</em>
          </p>
  
          <p className="font-thin text-2xl mb-6">
            That’s why I built ArtWorth — a smart, intuitive studio assistant and manager designed for today’s professional visual artist. 
            It’s more than a calculator; it’s a career tool. From pricing guidance that factors in time, materials, experience, and market trends, 
            to features that help track expenses, gallery commissions, and edition sizes, ArtWorth empowers you to make informed, confident business decisions.
          </p>
  
          <p className="font-thin text-2xl mb-6">
            Our mission is simple: to help artists value their work fairly, educate collectors about the real cost and value of art, 
            and contribute to a more transparent, thriving, and sustainable creative economy. 
            Whether you’re a painter, sculptor, photographer, or mixed-media artist, ArtWorth is here to help you focus on your art — 
            while we help with the numbers.
          </p>
  
          <p className="font-thin text-2xl mb-6">
            Looking ahead, ArtWorth will continue to grow with tools for inventory tracking, exhibition planning, 
            and AI-powered career insights — so your art career can thrive as much as your creativity.
