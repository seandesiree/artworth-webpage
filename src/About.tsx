      <p className="font-thin text-5xl ">
        ArtWorth was built by an artist who understands the challenges of making
        a living from creative work. After years of struggling with how to price
        pieces fairly and consistently, I decided to create a tool that would
        help artists — from emerging to established — set prices that reflect
        their time, skill, and value.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p className="font-thin text-5xl ">
        Our mission is to empower artists to price with confidence, educate
        collectors about the value of art, and create a more sustainable creative
        economy.
